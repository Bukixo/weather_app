### A web application which retrieves information from a weather APIÂ and displays the weather forecast for a selected location for the following week.

### Environment set up

- Set up a front-end tooling for angular with gulp using npm and bower

- attain api key from openweathermap and use REST client such as Insomia to explore the json data and figuring out what information is needed for the app.


### Logic set up

Creating http requests to make calls to the api. See weather.js comments for more information on the build.


### Front-end SET UP

I created cards which hold in the weather information, which the user can view by just scrolling the page. I wanted to give it a sunrise/sunset feel so I incorporated SCSS transition for the background of the cards.

Simplicty is key for this app so all the user needs to do is login in their desired city and code into the form and cards will update.


### How to run

run bower i && npm i  then gulp it.
